A new Flutter project.

The Flutter code initializes a mobile app interface presenting a scrollable list of users and their associated companies. It utilizes a ListView.separated widget to structure the list with dividers between each item. Each user is represented by a ListTile containing their name, an icon representing a face, their company, and another icon representing a phone.
